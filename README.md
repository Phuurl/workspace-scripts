# workspace-scripts

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Phuurl/workspace-scripts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Phuurl/workspace-scripts)

Scripts I use to automate the setup of new workspaces/environments. Should be considered a WIP.

## macOS

Basic package installation via Homebrew.

Run the Ansible playbook with `ansible-playbook -u <username> -i '127.0.0.1,' main.yml`, or use the shell scripts instead.

## Ubuntu

Shell scripts only - very basic. TODO: Add more things for Linux
